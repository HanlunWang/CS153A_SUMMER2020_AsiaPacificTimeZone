This repo is the Project of Brandeis CS 153A Summer 2020 Asia Pacific Time Zone Team. 

This project is a second hand items trading platform, based on react native, and can run on mobile devices. The final version is in ReactNativeProject file, which is written specifically for mobile devices. MinimumVersion is a web version of the app.

## Motivation
Our motivation is to creat a platform for university students to post and trade their items. Many students need to sell their books, furnitures, electronics after their graduation. So, we come up with the idea to build up a platform for them. 

## Installing and running
Use `cd ReactNativeProject` to access the project file. Then use
```
npm install
```
to install all the packages needed.
Then use
```
npm start
```
This will open an expo page in browser, which can let the app run in browser or on mobile devices.

The Profile lets users log in or sign up their account.

## Future
The app in now run based on local data. In future updates, we will connect it to a cloud data base. Also, the Profile feature now is not safe, we will connect our app with google+ and other account login service to let the login process safer. For the mobile device version, we will implement a better interface in the future. The web version now has a detailed describtion for every item, and also has the sellers contact information displayed after checking out. We will add these fetures to the mobile version later.
